            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Inspired by the collaboration and caffeine shared over coding projects, the creators of Code_lab Coffee decided venture into the world of coffee by creating a harmonious relationship with smaller, net-zero emission farms located in upstate New York. Roasted on-site at the flagship store in historic Bryant Park, their beans rich flavors create delicious drinks that inspire our patrons, served in 100% recycled and biodegradable cups and flatware.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Our Process - Take a peak inside!</h1>
            <p>Code_lab Coffee works exclusively with local, farmer owned coffee farms. Our 2016 beans have come from Daniel & Son Farms. Through our partnership, our seed-to-cup process has a carbon-neutral footprint.</p>
            <p>Selectively picked by our farmers, the beans go through a fermenting and drying process down to 11% moisture. Once they reach the perfect moisture level, the beans are milled to remove the outer husk and sorted by size. Code_lab Coffee work with our partnered farms to hand select the best beans for our coffee flavors.</p>
            <p>At this point, they beans are now referred to as green coffee. Roasting is the process that turns the green coffee into the aromatic brown beans. Our on-site roasting system keeps the beans in constant motion, preventing any burning or disruption of flavor. Our close relationships with our farms provide us with a constantly changing seasonal flavor collection, giving our patrons new options every time they visit.</p>
